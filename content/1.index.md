My name is Oleg Rõbnikov and I was born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1979. I completed my graduation from Concordia International University Estonia in 2003, and my career has been anything but conventional since then. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in diverse fields such as investment banking, web design, and even as a [PADI diving instructor](https://divewitholeg.com). However, it is my passion for web development that truly drives me.

In 2022, I decided to pursue my love for web development by registering my own web development company Oleg Rõbnikov Web Development. I have been actively pursuing my passion for front-end development with JavaScript and then, later with React, Vue and Nuxt, as well as back-end development with PHP and Laravel since my university years. I take pride in my ability to deploy websites on platforms such as Hostinger, Vercel, and AWS, showcasing my expertise in the field. One of my latest projects is a [free accounting service for freelancers and platform workers in Estonia](https://estoniafreelancerfinances.click/). The project is built in Laravel, Inertia, React with Tailwind styles. The project is using a CI/CD from Github built into Hostinger platform. Through my upcoming blog, I aim to share my knowledge and insights gained from publishing articles on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@rybniko) and [DevTo](https://dev.to/divewitholeg). I hope to offer a unique perspective on the world of web development and help my readers stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. Join me on my journey to explore the exciting world of web development!
