# Deployment

Deploying a Nuxt 3 application to Netlify is a breeze. Just a few clicks and you are done. I wish I could give a few comments, but there is just nothing to say. It is that easy. Same goes for Vercel.

This is exactly what I needed for my blog as there is no need to spend time on some fancy design or have it hosted on a dedicated server. I just need a place to write my articles and share them with the world.

Mainly it will reflect my progress in Nuxt, Vue and other related technologies. I will also share some of my thoughts on the current state of the web development and the future of the web.

One of the main reasons I chose this format is that anything I throw in contents folder and commit to the repository will be automatically deployed to the website. This is a great way to keep track of my progress and share it with the community.

What is left for the next attempts is to figure out how to deploy a Nuxt 3 application to AWS lambda. I don't need it for the blog, but it would be nice to have a working example for future projects as I already have a hunch that Nuxt 3 will be a great fit for serverless applications and this technology is becoming more and more popular.
