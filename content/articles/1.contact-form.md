# Grocking the contact form

Just deploy it they said... It will be easy they said... 
Unfortunately there is no mention of the contact form in the documentation. I have tried creating a PHP file in my root directory and adding the following code:

```mdc
::form{action="https://oleg-blog.tech/mail.php", method="POST"}
---
fields:
  - type: 'text'
  ...

```
Unfortunately this did not work.
